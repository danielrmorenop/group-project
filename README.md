********* Git *********

This is a step-by-step guide for when you want to start working on something. (assuming you just turned on your computer)

1)git checkout master
<makes sure you're in the master branch>

2)git pull origin master
<makes sure you have the latest version of code>

3)git checkout "branch"
<puts you in your branch now>

4)git merge master
<copies the latest version of master code to your branch>

DO YOUR EDITS, SAVE WORK

5)git add *
<adds your file to the 'commit stage'>

6)git commit -m "message"
<commits your edits to your branch>

7)git push
<officializes your changes to your branch!>

8)git checkout master
<puts you back in the master branch>

9)git pull
<pulls the latest version of master code, maybe someone made some edits>

10) git merge "branch"
<this will merge the edits you made in your branch, with the master branch>

11) git commit -m "message here"
<commits the merge of the two version -- make sure you resolve merge conflicts>

12) git push
<final step, push those merges!>

YOU MADE IT! maybe...
